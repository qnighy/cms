"For every submission, the score type of a task comes into play after the :"
"doc:`task type <Task types>` produced an outcome for each testcase. Indeed, "
"the most important duty of the score type is to describe how to translate "
"the list of outcomes into a single number: the score of the submission. The "
"score type also produces a more informative output for the contestants, and "
"the same information (score and detail) for contestants that did not use a "
"token on the submission. In CMS, these latter set of information is called "
"public, since the contestant can see them without using any tokens."

"Like task types, CMS has the most common score types built in. They are Sum, "
"GroupMin, GroupMul, GroupThreshold. There is also a score type called "
"Relative, but it is an experiment not meant for usage."

"The first of the four well-tested score types, Sum, is the simplest you can "
"imagine, just assigning a certain amount of points for each correct "
"testcases. The other three are useful for grouping together testcases and "
"assigning points for that group only if some conditions held. Groups are "
"also known as subtasks in some contests. The group score types also allow "
"test cases to be weighted, even for groups of size 1."

"This score type interprets the outcome for each testcase as a floating-point "
"number measuring how good the submission was in solving that testcase, where "
"0.0 means that the submission failed, and 1.0 that it solved the testcase "
"correctly. The score of that submission will be the sum of all the outcomes "
"for each testcase, multiplied by an integer parameter given in the Score "
"type parameter field in AdminWebServer. The parameter field must contain "
"only this integer. The public score is given by the same computation over "
"the public testcases instead of over all testcases."

"For example, if there are 20 testcases, 2 of which are public, and the "
"parameter string is ``5``, a correct solution will score 100 points (20 "
"times 5) out of 100, and its public score will be 10 points (2 times 5) out "

"With the GroupMin score type, outcomes are again treated as a measure of "
"correctness, from 0.0 (incorrect) to 1.0 (correct); testcases are split into "
"groups, and each group has an integral multiplier. The score is the sum, "
"over all groups, of the minimum outcome for that group times the multiplier. "
"The public score is computed over all groups in which all testcases within "
"are public."

"More precisely, the parameters string for GroupMin is of the form :samp:`"
"[[{m1}, {t1}], [{m2}, {t2}], ...]`, meaning that the first group comprises "
"the first :samp:`{t1}` testcases and has multiplier :samp:`{m1}`; the second "
"group comprises the testcases from the :samp:`{t1}` + 1 to the :samp:`{t1}` "

"GroupMul is almost the same as GroupMin; the only difference is that instead "
