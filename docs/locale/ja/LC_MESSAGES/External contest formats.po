"The first is that of contest admins, that for several reasons (storage of "
"old contests, backup, distribution of data) want to export the contest "
"original data (tasks, contestants, ...) together with all data generated "
"during the contest (from the contestants, submissions, user tests, ... and "
"from the system, evaluations, scores, ...). Once a contest has been exported "
"in this format, CMS must be able to reimport it in such a way that the new "
"instance is indistinguishable from the original."

"The second is that of contest creators, that want an environment that helps "
"them design tasks, testcases, and insert the contest data (contestant names "
"and so on). The format needs to be easy to write, understand and modify, and "
"should provide tools to help developing and testing the tasks (automatic "
"generation of testcases, testing of solutions, ...). CMS must be able to "
"import it as a new contest, but also to import it over an already created "
"contest (after updating some data)."

"As for the second set of needs, the philosophy is that CMS should not force "
"upon contest creators a particular environment to write contests and tasks. "
"Therefore, we encourage you to write importer and reimporter scripts, "
"modeled upon those we wrote for the environment used in the Italian "
"Olympiads, that can be run with the commands :file:`cmsYamlImporter` and :"
"file:`cmsYamlReimporter` and inspected at :gh_blob:`cmscontrib/YamlImporter."
"py` and :gh_blob:`cmscontrib/YamlReimporter.py`. If you want to use the "
"Italian environment there is a description in the next section, but please "
"be aware that it has severe limitations: for example, many handles are in "
"Italian and the support for complex task types is a bit cumbersome."
