"Here, you can create a contest clicking the \"+\" next to the drop down on "
"the left. After that, you must add the tasks and the users. Up to now, each "
"of these operations is manual; plus, it is usually more practical to work, "
"for example, on a file specifying the contestants' details instead of using "
"the web interface."

"The idea we wanted to implement is that CMS does not get in the way of how "
"you create your contest and your tasks (unless you want to). We think that "
"every national IOI selection team and every contest administrator has a "
"preferred way of developing the tasks, and of storing their data in the "
"filesystem, and we do not want to change the way you work."

"Instead, you are encouraged to write an \"importer\", that is a piece of "
"software that reads data from your filesystem structure and creates the "
"contest in the database. You can also write a \"reimporter\" if you want to "
"change the contest details without losing the data (submissions, user "
"tests, ...) already uploaded."

"We provide examples of both importer and reimporter that target the format "

"dev/con_test>`_, while its explanation is :doc:`here <External contest "
